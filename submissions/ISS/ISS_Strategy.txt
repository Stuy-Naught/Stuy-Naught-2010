ISS Strategy:

1.  Our satellite will stay near the sun in the beginning of the game, running an offensive strategy by repelling our opponent for some amount of time.
2.  Eventually we leave the sun and go towards our panel to search.
3.  Once we find and dock to the panel, we will either
    A) Sit still for the rest of the game (most likely), or
    B) Return to an offensive strategy (repelling the opponent) if it is necessary and we have enough fuel.
