Some Questions/tasks:

1. Having gotten to the center of the Panel plane, how do we
start a rotation of 12 degrees/sec so that we can check, each
second, whether we're looking at the panel or not.

2. If we repel the opponent when we are both at the respective
centers of the panel pane, is this repulsion strong enough to prevent the opponent from 
finding his panel?

3. Many experiments with collisions to see if we can understand what they do

4. A function that implements their algorithm to detect whether we'll have a collision
in the next 10 seconds (3 seconds?)

5. A Simple-Opponent needs to be created that we can race against.  This opponent
takes no offensive measures and the only defensive measure is to take a non-direct
path from panel plane to station plane to avoid the other SPHERE.
