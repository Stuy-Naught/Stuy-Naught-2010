// movement test


/*  

purpose -- to provide position data on a movment from start to center of panel initalization circle

method -- move from start to end, recording disance to target and time
	  using ZRSetPositionTarget(target);

Usage -- Copy the code below to the ZR user portion of the simulator and copy vfunc (code only) to a simulator funtion area
	 Run for about 35 seconds.
	Open the console window before running.
	After running,  copy the contents of the console window to notepad or equivalent, 
		producing a csv file
	Save the file with a .txt or .csv extension. 
	For further analysis, open the file with excel or another spreadsheet program.

variations  -- the target could be changed
		the starting point could be changed, using game variables rather than the default
		

notes -- the console sometimes does not record the first 5 seconds; you may have to restart the simulator
	 a results spreadsheet has been posted with this file
	


uses Vfunct

Globals  -- none
